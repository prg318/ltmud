# LTmud #
LTmud is a Multi-User Dungeon client designed to be simple and robust.  It is written in Python with portability in mind.  The UI is written in GTK+2 and is the only dependency other than python itself.

LTmud has a plug-in interface.  Unfortunately, it is not documented (and probably never will be at this point) but there are examples in the source tree.

LTmud is no longer maintained.

I wrote LTmud to scratch a personal itch of there not being a decent GTK MUD client for Linux at the time.  Little did I know at the time that TinTin is awesome.

**UPDATE** I have been using GGmud (which is based off of and includes the power of TinTin) and plan on contributing directly to the ggmud code base at some point:

I've heard that mudlet is sweet as well:
